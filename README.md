# SARS-CoV-2 Variant Analysis

This repository contains the files for a computational biology analysis project focused on SARS-CoV-2 variants. The project includes data visualization, variant sequence analysis, and a report detailing the spread and characteristics of COVID-19 variants worldwide.

## Files
- `ev01.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the full analysis and code for sequence processing, GC percentage calculation, and visualization.
- `ev01.pdf`: A rendered PDF report summarizing the findings from the analysis.

## Project Overview
The analysis includes:
1. **Current COVID-19 Situation**: Global, national (Mexico), and regional insights.
2. **Variant Investigation**: Details on variants of concern and interest, including their characteristics and global distribution.
3. **DNA Sequence Analysis**: Processing and visualizing nucleotide sequences of multiple variants (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Delta).
4. **Key Findings**: Observations on GC content, sequence similarities, and potential areas for further study.
